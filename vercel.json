## ✅ ALTERNATIVE: Let me give you the EXACT Vercel URL

Since I can't see your exact project, try these URLs:

**Replace `YOUR-PROJECT-NAME` with your actual project name:**

1. **Settings URL format:**
```
   https://vercel.com/YOUR-USERNAME/placeholder-publication/settings
```

2. **Try this direct link:**
```
   https://vercel.com/whatsupsingapore/placeholder-publication/settings
